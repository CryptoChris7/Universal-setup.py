# Universal-setup.py
A single setup.py file for all my Python projects

To use, simply copy paste the setup.py file in this repo into the top level
of a Python project. This file requires Python 3.5 or greater. Making it work
 with an earlier version should be pretty simple, but I'm not interested in
 writing any code for old versions of Python at the moment.
